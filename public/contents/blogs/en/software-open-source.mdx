## What is Open Source Software?

Hello! Today we'll embark on an exciting journey into the world of open source software. Open source software refers to software whose source code can be viewed, modified, and shared by anyone. To explain this with an everyday example, we can compare regular software to a locked box and open source software to a transparent box. You can see what's inside this transparent box, modify its contents, and even share it with others.

## Advantages of Open Source Software

Open source software has many advantages that make the software world more democratic and accessible:

### Cost Advantage
Most open source software is free. This is especially advantageous for new developers, small businesses, and students. For example, you can use WordPress for free to create a website.

### Learning Opportunities
You can learn by examining others' code. This is an invaluable opportunity for someone learning programming. You can improve your own skills by seeing how experienced developers write code.

### Community Support
You can access a large community of millions of developers and users worldwide. This community helps solve your problems and continuously improves the software.

## Core Features of Open Source Software

For software to be truly open source, it must have certain core features:

1. **Access to Source Code**: The software's source code must be viewable by everyone.
2. **Freedom to Modify**: You can modify the code according to your needs.
3. **Freedom to Distribute**: You can share the software and your modifications with others.
4. **License Compliance**: Must be licensed under one of the open source licenses (e.g., MIT, GPL, Apache).

## Difference Between Open Source and Free Software

Although these two terms are often confused, there are important differences between them. The Free Software movement was started by Richard Stallman and embraces software freedom as a philosophy. The word "Free" here is used in the sense of "freedom," not "free of charge."

Open source software takes a more pragmatic approach and focuses on the practical benefits of collaboration. In other words, while open source adopts the technical principles of free software, it doesn't mandate its philosophical approach.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Open Source Software

### Advantages
- Cost savings
- Transparency and security
- Customization options

- Documentation may be lacking
- Compatibility issues may arise

## Most Popular Open Source Software

### Linux
Linux is the world's most widely used operating system kernel, started by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Linux runs on everything from Android phones to supercomputers. To understand Linux, think of it as a building's foundation - different floors (distributions) can be built on top of it.

Recommended Linux distributions for beginners:
- **Ubuntu**: The most popular and user-friendly Linux distribution
- **Linux Mint**: Ideal for those wanting to transition from Windows with its similar interface
- **Elementary OS**: A distribution notable for its macOS-like appearance

You can try Linux using a virtual machine or create a "Live USB" to run it without installing it on your computer.
