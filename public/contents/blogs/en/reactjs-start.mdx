# Welcome to ReactJS! 🚀

We're about to embark on an exciting journey into the world of ReactJS. React is a powerful JavaScript library used for building modern web applications. Don't worry, I'll explain everything step by step in a friendly way. Let's get started!

## 🛠 Setting Up Our Project

First, we'll create our React project using Vite, a modern and fast development environment. Vite is super fast and really easy to use!

### First Steps

1. **Open the Terminal**
   First, let's open the terminal and type the following command:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   ```

2. **Installation Confirmation**
   The terminal will ask you "Ok to proceed? (y)". This is our friendly "shall we continue?" question! 😊 Just type `y` and press Enter.

3. **Project Settings**
   Now we'll make the following selections in order:
   - **Project name**: Enter your project name (for example: 'lesson')
   - **Select a framework**: Use arrow keys to select React ⬆️ ⬇️
   - **Select a variant**: Let's choose JavaScript

4. **Final Steps**
   Now we'll run these commands in order:
   ```bash
   cd lesson
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

🎉 **Congratulations!** Your React project is now ready and running!

The terminal will give you a URL (usually http://localhost:5173). When you open this address in your browser, you'll see your first React application. Isn't that amazing?

## 🎯 What We Learned?
- How to quickly create a React project with Vite
- How to use basic npm commands
- How to start a development server

## 🚀 What's Next?
This is just the beginning! Together, we'll explore the amazing world of React. Components, state management, and much more await us!

💡 **Tip**: If you get stuck somewhere, don't worry! Everyone started somewhere. The important thing is to progress step by step and practice.

Let's continue learning together! 🌟
