Instead of passively watching videos or reading documentation, you should immediately put what you learn into practice. Here are some tips:

- Develop small projects
- Try to write code examples on your own
- Teach what you've learned to others

### 2. The Pomodoro Technique

You can manage your study process with this amazing technique:

- Work uninterrupted for 25 minutes
- Take a 5-minute break
- Take a 15-30 minute long break after 4 pomodoros

1. Choose the topic you want to learn
2. Explain it simply as if you're teaching a friend
3. Identify difficult points and study them again
4. Simplify your explanation even further
